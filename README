#README File

Trying to document what I'm attempting to do here, so I can pick it up after a few weeks.

Long story short - this is a tinkering project. It has no explicit goal in mind apart from exploring the Discovery STM32F4 board. It's also an experiment with static linked libraries targetting bare metal with cmake and a full gnu toolchain (almost).

I'm relying on st-util to start a communication path to the board.

gdb-multiarch to debug and load the executable on the board.

Already failed, it's been awhile since I put this down. I've got an e-Ink display that can be talked to via SPI. I don't have it wired up correctly yet and it's some cheapy off Amazon with no documentation and some examples relying on a 3rd party library. So I'll have to do some basic experimentation on that.

Plus I have no idea how the F4 works with a SPI Interface.

Last think I was trying to do before I put this down was get the systick event firing to put in a rudimentary scheduling system.

or maybe not since that's the most I've thought about it.
